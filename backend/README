# OTP Backend (Node.js + Redis)

This backend implements OTP-based authentication using Node.js, Express, and Redis.

What It Does

Generates a 6-digit OTP on the backend

Stores OTP in Redis with a 5-minute expiry

Verifies OTP securely

SMS sending is abstracted via Fast2SMS

API Endpoints

POST /api/otp/send → Send OTP

POST /api/otp/verify → Verify OTP

# SMS Note (Important)

Fast2SMS API key is valid

OTP delivery is blocked unless:

DLT registration is completed OR

Quick API is enabled with minimum recharge

This is a provider compliance requirement, not a code issue
